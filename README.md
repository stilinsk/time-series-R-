# time-series-R-


In the trnd,seasonality and noise model we  We use the decompose function to decompose both time series into their trend, seasonality, and remainder (noise) components, which are stored in 'decomp_gas' and 'decomp_electric.'
We create separate plots for the original time series, trend component, seasonal component, and remainder component for both "GasUse" and "ElectricUse."
